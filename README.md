# Easy Finance NZ

Easy Finance NZ is a simple Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using React TypeScript to do some basic calculations and show their results for New Zealand financial contexts.

NOTE: The financial contexts for New Zealand used are updated till 15th April 2022. Any changes to policies may not be updated/reflected here. Use of this application is subject to your own risk. The major purpose of the application is for quick indicative calculations as well as showcasing the technology used - it is not for legal/taxation advice/purposes.

The application is currently available on https://osamakashif.github.io/Easy_Finance_NZ/.
